# React in Docker
For Installing Dependencies in Docker
✅ Prerequisites on Host PC

**Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)**  
You must have Docker installed and running.  
- For Windows & Mac: [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)  
- For Linux: Install `docker` package via your distro (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`, `pacman`).  

**System Requirements for Docker**  
- Windows: Enable **WSL2 backend** (Docker Desktop will guide you).  
- Mac: Works out of the box.  
- Linux: Make sure your user is added to the `docker` group (`sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`).  

**Basic Command Line**  
You’ll run commands in **PowerShell / CMD (Windows)**, or **Terminal (Linux/Mac)**.  

**Folder Sharing Permissions**  
Docker needs access to your local drive for volume mounting.  
- On Windows Docker Desktop, go to **Settings → Resources → File Sharing** and ensure `D:\React\vite-docker` (or your chosen folder) is allowed.  

---

❌ Not Required on Host PC  

- **Node.js / npm** → Not needed locally, since we’re using Docker’s Node.js image.  
- **Vite** → Not needed locally, installed globally inside the Docker image.  
- **Git** → Optional, only if you want to version-control your project.  

---

⚡ Recommended (Optional but Helpful)  

- **VS Code (or any editor)** → for editing your React project files.  
  - Install the **Docker extension** in VS Code if you want easy container management.  
- **Browser** → Chrome/Edge/Firefox to preview your app.
